/**
 * Reactive keyed list. Renders one row per item in `from`, keyed by the
 * item's `AtomRef` identity. Adds/removes only the rows that changed —
 * unaffected rows stay mounted with their DOM and subscriptions intact.
 *
 * Generic `T` is preserved through the function call site (which JSX
 * component tags can't do because of higher-rank polymorphism limits in
 * TypeScript). Use as `{list(coll, (item) => <Row item={item} />)}`.
 *
 * `index` is a reactive `ReadonlyRef<number>`, not a plain number: when a row
 * shifts position (because an earlier row was added or removed) or is reordered,
 * `mount` pushes the new index into this ref without re-rendering the row. Read
 * it as `index.value` (the compiler routes that through `h.read`, so it tracks
 * like any other ref) to display a live position.
 *
 * **Breaking:** `index` was a plain `number` in earlier versions; it is now a
 * `ReadonlyRef<number>`. Migrate `i` → `i.value` (and note `i` can no longer be
 * used in arithmetic without `.value`).
 *
 * Row channels fold through (#72 review): a row's live `E` (a typed failing
 * handler, an open `Async`) rides `View<E>` out of the list, and a row's `R`
 * (a service-using handler, a construction `yield*`) surfaces on the result —
 * the node captures the construction context (`ViewList.context`) and every
 * row builds on it, so the Layer demanded here is genuinely the one the rows
 * see, including under a mid-tree `Effect.provide`. The per-row `Scope` is
 * supplied by the list runtime and excluded from the folded `R`, so a parent
 * rendering the list stays Scope-free. The Effect shell carries `E`/`R`
 * through the child fold (and performs the capture).

 * The fiber is `forkScoped`-d: the stream is interrupted when the enclosing

 * placeholder split of the pull side (in-component fetch vs `Async`):
 * - **omitted** — construction *waits for the first element* by the same
 *   mechanism as `yield* http.getUser`: the first pull runs ON the
 *   constructing fiber (no forked producer, no hand-off), so the wait owns
 *   its work and teardown behaves exactly like a blocking fetch. A stream
 *   that never emits blocks construction (like a fetch that never resolves)
 *   — give sparse streams an `initial`; a stream that ENDS before its first
 *   element is a defect (fails loud, never hangs).
 * - **provided** — construction returns immediately; the ref holds `initial`
 *   until the first emission.
 *
 * The error channel must be `never`: a stream's failure happens *after*
 * construction succeeded, so there is no honest Effect channel to ride —
 * handle failures as values at the stream level (`Stream.catch*`,
 * `Stream.retry`, encode them in `A`) before handing it over. This mirrors
 * Effect's own boundary: `Atom.make(stream)` wraps state in `AsyncResult`
 * for the same reason; `streamRef` keeps the sync-read `A` contract instead
 * and pushes the failure story onto the stream where the combinators live.
 * Why not `Atom.make(stream)`: its source must already be context-free
 * (`R = AtomRegistry`), so a service-needing stream forces `Atom.runtime` —
 * which bakes the Layer and discharges `R`, losing the thesis. Running on
 * the mount fiber is what keeps `R` folded (same design as `asyncRef`).

 * note: a boundary `reset` over a handle re-renders the handle's CURRENT
 * state and does not refetch (with a thunk, reset reconstructs the asyncRef →
 * fresh fetch); a still-failed handle re-escalates on rebuild, so compose
 * `() => { user.refetch(); reset() }` when retry should do both. (A
 * `<Async from initial failure success/>` JSX element that lowers to this
 * positional call is *planned*, not yet implemented — use the call form.)

 *
 * Sugar over `asyncRef` + `AsyncResult.match`: `from` runs on the mount fiber so
 * its `R` folds into the component (forgotten Layer = compile error). The
 * `failure` arm picks the error's home, per call site (mirroring `Catch`'s
 * function-vs-object forms):
 *
 *  - **function** — catch-all: every failure is handled here as a value (the
 *    arm gets the full `Cause<E>` plus `retry`) and the result is
 *    `Effect<View<never>, never, R | Scope>` — fully discharged, nothing for a
 *    boundary to see.
 *  - **tag map** — `failure: { NotFound: (e) => … }`: a matched tag is handled
 *    here (the handler gets the unwrapped error) and the fetch loop STAYS
 *    LIVE — a dep change still refetches, so the view can recover with no
 *    boundary `reset`. The residual rides the live channel:
 *    `Effect<View<Exclude<E, { _tag }>>, never, R | Scope>`. Dispatch is
 *    `Catch`'s tag-map dispatch (the cause's first error, when tagged; own,
 *    function-valued keys — prefer inline literals: pre-built/widened maps
 *    can over-discharge, see #91). A typo'd key mixed with ≥1 valid key is
 *    silently dead — its tag stays on the channel. A tag map on an `E` with
 *    no tagged members is rejected at compile time.
 *  - **omitted** — the failure **rides the live channel**: the result is
 *    `Effect<View<E>, never, R | Scope>`, the failure (initial fetch *or* any
 *    refetch) routes to the nearest enclosing `Catch`, and `mount`'s
 *    `View<never>` gate makes a missing boundary a compile error naming `E`.
 *    The boundary's `reset` re-runs construction → a fresh fetch.
 *
 * Every failure handler (catch-all and tag-map) receives `retry: () => void`
 * as its last argument — it re-runs the thunk with a fresh dep snapshot, the
 * leaf analog of `Catch`'s `reset` (which re-runs *construction*). While the
 * re-run is in flight the `initial` arm renders (a stale error isn't content,
 * so failure-waiting doesn't get the stale-while-revalidate treatment that
 * success-waiting does). Call `retry` from event handlers only — calling it
 * during render (`failure: (c, retry) => { retry(); … }`) refetches in an

/**
 * View-level error boundary — `Catch`. Mirrors Effect's `catch*`: recover the
 * FAILURE side of a view subtree, let success pass through (the child renders
 * itself). Contrast `Async`, which matches a data `AsyncResult` and renders
 * *every* state — a boundary supplies only the failure fallback. Two forms,
 * picked by the second argument:
 *
 *  - **catch-all** — a function handler gets the precise `Cause<EC | EV>` and
 *    discharges *every* error to `never` (mountable):
 *    ```tsx
 *    {Catch(<UserCard id={id} />, (cause, reset) =>
 *      <div class="err">{Cause.pretty(cause)}<button onclick={reset}>retry</button></div>)}
 *    ```
 *  - **tag-selective** — a map of `_tag → handler` for any subset of the child's
 *    error tags (each handler gets the unwrapped tagged error). The result
 *    **narrows** both channels by `Exclude<E, { _tag }>`, so a leftover tag must
 *    still be discharged before `mount`. A non-matching error escalates to the
 *    next boundary out.
 *    ```tsx
 *    {Catch(<UserCard id={id} />, {
 *      HttpError: (e, reset) => <Banner status={e.status} onRetry={reset} />,
 *      ParseError: (e) => <p>bad data: {e.message}</p>,
 *    })}
 *    ```
 *
 * Catches both phases — **construction** (`child`'s build Effect fails) and
 * **live** (a post-mount reactive re-render or event-handler Effect). `reset()`
 * re-runs construction. `child`'s `R` folds (construction + every reset run on
 * the mount fiber); the fallback's own `E`/`R` are not folded — keep it pure
 * markup, like `Async`'s arms. Tag-selective only catches errors in the *type*;
 * an untyped event-handler or reactive error needs the catch-all form.
